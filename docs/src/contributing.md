## Local Development

1. Add `@freecodecamp/freecodecamp-os` to `package.json > dependencies`, pointing to the current directory:

```json
"@freecodecamp/freecodecamp-os": "."
```

**Note:** This is temporary, as the package should not reference itself as a dependency when published.

2. Install tooling:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Start the development server:

- Open the command pallete (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- `freeCodeCamp: Run Develop`
